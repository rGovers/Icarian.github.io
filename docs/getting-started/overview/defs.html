            <h1>Definitions</h1>

            <p>Definition refered to as Defs, are a structure used to define how everything is made and what data it contains. They are created with XML but in this we will not worry about that and mostly just use the editor. We will not worry about the extra stuff and focus on using them to build GameObject and Components getting started.</p>

            <p>Defs can be in two different scopes global and scene</p>

            <p>They are pretty flexible can be used like prefabs in most other engines.</p>
