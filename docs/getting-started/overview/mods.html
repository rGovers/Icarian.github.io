            <h1>Mods</h1>

            <p>Everything in Icarian is a mod. If you are creating a game you just happen to be the Core mod. A mod can be made up of several things Defs, Scenes, Assets, Assemblies, and Scribe files. The latter of which will be explored later.</p>

            <p>More in depth modding info will be explored in a seperate section as not everything directly relates to building a game.</p>

            <p>Still very Work in Process.</p>
