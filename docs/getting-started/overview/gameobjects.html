            <p>These are the building blocks of games. They are comprised of a collection of components and a transformation. They are can be created from Defs or created in code. They also contain a reference to the def used in construction of the Game Object.</p>

            <p>They are pretty similar as to what you would find in other engines. Except that they can be extended for further functionality.</p>
