            <h1>What is Icarian Engine?</h1>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            
            <p>Icarian Engine is a general purpose 3D engine designed to have inbuilt mod support and target multiple platforms. The aim is to make mod support less of a labour for developers by having it at engine level in hopes that modding support comes to more games.</p>

            <p>It is currently in development and highly experimental.</p>

            <h2>How does it look?</h2>

            <p>Icarian Engine has a editor with integrated tools to ease development. It includes scene views, def editing, and a profiler.</p>

            <h2>What platforms are supported</h2>

            <p>Icarian supports Windows and Linux using Vulkan with more planned to come.</p>

            <h2>Programming language</h2>

            <p>Icarian uses C# for scripting. Running in an embedded mono runtime. The editor handles all the project files so you can just create a C# script and run the game in the editor without having to mess around.</p>
